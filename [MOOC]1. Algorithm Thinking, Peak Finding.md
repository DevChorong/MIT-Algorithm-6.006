### # Algorithmic Thinking - Peak Finding

1D : Peak Finder

a-i are Number

Position 2 is a peak if and only if b>= a and b >= c , Position 9 is a peak if i >= h

( 즉, 만약 포지션2(b) 가 최대값일때 b는 a보다 크고 c보다 크다 == 양 옆보다 크다. )

Problem : Find a peak if it peaks

### # Straight forward Algorithm

Strat from left 

[ it's mean increasing gradually to accept middle(n/2) and decreasing gradually to accept end (n) ]
